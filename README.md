# OptiTest
A method for adaptive testing in education

### Overview

Standardized testing has been a common tool used by educators for decades
to assess student performance and facilitate promotion of students through cur-
riculum. However, individual differences in background, learning style, and abil-
ities make standardized tests a crude and inefficient method of assessment. New
techniques in artificial intelligence and statistical models related to student perfor-
mance offer an alternative through adaptive testing techniques. We explore one
implementation of this named Opti-test.
